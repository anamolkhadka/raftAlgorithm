# This is readme file for the Raft Consensus Algorithm.

# Assignment Summary:
- Implement Raft Consensus algorithm where Raft achieves fault-tolerance consensus, handle leader election, maintain log consistency, and manage distributed state transitions.
- Nodes will communicate with each other using gRPC and each node must be containerized using Docker.
- Use two languages to implement Raft.
- State of each node: Follower -> Candidate -> Leader
